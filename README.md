# job-shop-scheduling-problem
JSS Problem solved using Artificial Intelligence techniques
Problem Statement: 
Given n jobs, each composed of m operations that must be processed on m machines.
Each operation uses one of the m machines for a fixed duration.
Each machine can process at most one operation at a time and once an operation initiates processing on a given machine it must complete processing on that machine without interruption.
The operations of a given job have to be processed in a given order.
The problem is to find a schedule of the operations on the machines, taking into account the precedence constraints, and minimizes the makespan, that is, the finish time of the last operation completed in the schedule.
